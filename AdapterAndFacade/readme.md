# Adaper and Facade Patterns

## Difference
"The difference between the Adapter and Facade pattern is not in terms of how many classes they 'wrap', it is in their intent. The intent of the Adapter Pattern is to later an interface so that it matches one a client is expecting. The intent of the Facade Pattern is to provide a simplified interface to a subsystem."
"Facades and adapters may wrap multiple classes, but a facade's intent is to simplify, while an adapters's is to convert the interface to something different."
